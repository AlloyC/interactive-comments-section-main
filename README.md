  ## Overview
  
  ### The challenge
  
  Users should be able to:
  
  - View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
  - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
  - Create, Read, Update, and Delete comments and replies
  - Upvote and downvote comments
  - **Bonus**: If you're building a purely front-end project, use `localStorage` to save the current state in the browser that persists when the browser is refreshed.
  - **Bonus**: Instead of using the `createdAt` strings from the `data.json` file, try using timestamps and dynamically track the time since the comment or reply was posted.

  ## My process
  
  ### Built with
  
  - Semantic HTML5 markup
  - CSS custom properties
  - Flexbox
  - CSS Grid
  - Mobile-first workflow
  - javascript
  
  ### What I learned
  
  This project have really helped me increase my knowledge of javascript. Working with fetch api, localStorage and json file have challenged me by building my mindsite toward javascript algorithms. I learned why pages refreshs when data is submitted to a database and how to prevent html tags from running when inputted by a user in an input/ textarea tag dynamically added to te DOM using javascript innerHTML. Also I finally used javascript splice method, callback function and ReGex in a real project.
  
  ```js
  tweetsOutput += `
      <p class="content"></p>
      
      <div id="create-comment" class="create-replies bg-light">
        <img class="comment-img" src="${data.currentUser.image.png}" alt="profile picture" />
        <textarea class="textarea" name=""  rows="5" placeholder="Add a comment..."></textarea>
        <button class="send cl-light bg-blue fw-500">SEND</button>
      </div>
    `
    tweets.style.display = 'none';
      tweets.innerHTML = tweetsOutput;
      document.querySelector(`#comments-${index} .container .content`).innerText = document.querySelector('.textarea').value;
  ```
  
  ### Continued development
  
  I made use of a lot of nexted if statement as I'm not quite comfortable with switch statement.I would be learning more on switch statement inorder to up my javascript conditioning gameüòÅ.
  
  ### Useful resources
  
  - [w3schools](https://www.w3schools.com) - w3schools really helped understand many javascript concept during this project. It is a very resourceful website to learning to code.
  - [stackoverflow](https://www.stackoverflow.com) - stackoverflow is my go to website when i get really stuck on a particular code. It has a lot of solution to problems you'll probabily face during coding. It's a really helpful site.
  - [freeCodeCamp](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn) - I learnt a lot about coding from freeCodeCamp.
